# pdf-to-video
A program that takes a video and converts it into a pdf using Scene Boundary Shot Detection


Motivation to make this :  So my professor decided to give us a video recording of the slides that he used to teach us instead of the usual way of giving us a pdf of the slides.
His reason being that students used those slides to cheat in exam. So I did this project as a challenge and now I can easily convert his videos to pdfs :D
